// File: simple.php
//
// Description: This file is part of PHP RegPortal, which is derived
//               from Deadlock PHP User Management System.
//               The changes made to this include revisions to support using
//               PDO for database operations and support for Apache httpd.conf
//               based configuration and having authenticaiton via
//               mod_dbd/mod_authn_dbd, rather than .htaccess and .htpasswd.
//               This has resulted in significant rewrite of base code, hence
//               new project, which is not backward compatible with Deadlock
//
// Note: All original Deadlock notices remain intact and this code is in
//         turn provided under GNU General Public Licence V3 as per
//         Deadlock code.
//         The Tux Logo has been removed and replaceid with MySQL & PostgreSQL
//         logo's as key aim was to make this version RDBMS agnostic via
//         PHP's PDO functions.
//         The new RegPortal logo includes original Deadlock logo (in miniture)
//         in recognition of the fact that this is derived work.
//         The Apache logo is included in the new logo, as this program
//         generates Apache specific outputs... and assumes Apache is the
//         underlying Web Server. However this code is not ensured
//         or otherwise related to Apache Software Foundation.
