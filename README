PHP RegPortl is:
A very simple PHP based user registration system for
PHP/Apache/MySQL/PostgreSQL based applications

This software provides a PHP based user registration portal and authentication
system. The application uses Apache mod_dbd/mod_authn_dbd
(or .htaccess/.htpasswd) to provide RDMS independent authentication.

The registration Portal is built using PHP with PHP Data Objects (PDO) to
isolate it from specific RDBMS providers. The system is a substantial
modification and rewrite of the "Deadlock - User Management System" and was
created to address the limitation of this while still having the useful
functionality and not being over encumbered with to many application
development frameworks (ie keep it simple).
