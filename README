1. Installation & Configuration

The PHP RegPortal has 3 set of user interfaces and functionality
these are targeted at: system administrators, user adminstrators and end users.

To correctly configure PHP RegPortal so it is secure you should:

a) Configure Apache so that the install directory is protected.
	The install directory has an example htaccess file to use as template for protecting the directory.
	This should only be accessible to the system adminstrators.
b) Ensure the admin is protected so only authourised adminstrators can access it.
	As part of bootstrapping PHP RegPortal, you can configure this as initial area to be protected
	and have adminstration specific RDBMS conifigured to handle authentication to this realm.
c) Users should use access RegPortal via embedded links, which ensure that the application specific configuration
	file is passed in as a parameter.
d) Make use of the roles and permissions that have been granted as part of installing a RegPortal database.
	The three roles created are <prefix>_user, <prefix>_admin, <prefix>_owner.
	Each of these roles is is defined as "NOLOGIN" and are used by granting role to connected users when using the database
	The following set of permissions have been defined for the roles:
	user - Has Update Access to <prefix>_users, to allow then to register themselves and updated their own password
		and check credentials. Tney also have Update access to login, to allow recording of failed login attempts
	admin - Has Delete acess to <prefix>_users, to allow then to remove users
	owner - Has Update access to emails and config configuration data. This allows them to change behavior of RegPortal
	NOTE: owner inherits admin rights who inherits user rights.
